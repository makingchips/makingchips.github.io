  <p>Here’s my subject matter for these tests and rants and ravings, a Commander 114 door pull…</p>

<p><img src="_images/doorpull.jpg" alt="Door Pull"></p>

<p>The factory made these out of a very thin molded plastic.  Airplanes, of course, operate in extreme environments.  They go from extreme heat on the ground to extreme cold at altitude in a matter of minutes, and those abrupt changes in heat/cold/moisture in a short period of time are not conducive to longevity in plastics.  Add to that the fact that these are a common wear item from being jerked on by hamfisted pilots and passengers, and they’re a regular point of failure on these airplanes.</p>

<p class="message">
They’d look a lot better made out of aluminum…
</p>

<p>As it turns out, this seemingly simple part seems to be a pretty good test of CAD/CAM software functionality.  It’s a small item that can be cut and/or simulated in a hurry even on a small machine, and  it has both 2d and 3d elements.  The bottom could be cut as a 2d item quite easily and quickly, whereas the top has the molded edges that require a 3d toolpath.  If cut from a single GCode file it will also need to have a reversal/fixture change in the middle of the process.  </p>
