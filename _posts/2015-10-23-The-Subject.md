As it turns out, this seemingly simple part seems to be a pretty good test of CAD/CAM software functionality.  It’s a small item that can be cut and/or simulated in a hurry even on a small machine, and  it has both 2d and 3d elements.  The bottom could be cut as a 2d item quite easily and quickly, whereas the top has the molded edges that require a 3d toolpath.  If cut from a single GCode file it will also need to have a reversal/fixture change in the middle of the process.
