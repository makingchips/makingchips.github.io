These would look a lot better in aluminum…

As it turns out, the below seemingly simple part seems to be a pretty good test of CAD/CAM software functionality.  It’s a small item that can be cut and/or simulated in a hurry even on a small machine, and  it has both 2d and 3d elements.  The bottom could be cut as a 2d item quite easily and quickly, whereas the top has the molded edges that require a 3d toolpath.  If cut from a single GCode file it will also need to have a reversal/fixture change in the middle of the process.

So with the above in mind, this is my subject matter for these tests and rants and ravings, a Commander 114 door pull.

The factory made these out of a very thin molded plastic.  Airplanes, of course, operate in extreme environments.  They go from extreme heat on the ground to extreme cold at altitude in a matter of minutes, and those abrupt changes in heat/cold/moisture in a short period of time are not conducive to longevity in plastics.  Add to that the fact that these are a common wear item from being jerked on by ham-fisted pilots and passengers, and they’re a regular point of failure on these airplanes.
