Here’s my subject matter for these tests and rants and ravings, a Commander 114 door pull…

The factory made these out of a very thin molded plastic.  Airplanes, of course, operate in extreme environments.  They go from extreme heat on the ground to extreme cold at altitude in a matter of minutes, and those abrupt changes in heat/cold/moisture in a short period of time are not conducive to longevity in plastics.  Add to that the fact that these are a common wear item from being jerked on by hamfisted pilots and passengers, and they’re a regular point of failure on these airplanes.
